1. What did GitHub Copilot help you with?
    --> It helps me write and complete a part of my PowerShell script faster. It suggested a code for creating a user, checking if the user already exists, and adding the user to the "Users" group. It also help with filling in missing commands and syntax (like Write-Host and if blocks).

2. What challenges did you face?
    --> In terms of the code itself, I did not run into any issues. It was mostly on navigating to the folders . I guess there was a small part int he code where it failed to add the created user to the "Users" group because the account was not fully registered yet.

3. What did you learn?
    --> The most obvious is learning how to create and rin a PowerShell script on Windows, while also using GitHub with it. Also leanring that GitHUb Copilot can help speed up coding as I actually never knew this before.
